## Interpretation

### Performance

- HalfVec (fp16) provides a **55.6%** speedup compared to FP32 vectors
- Bit vectors provide a **123.6%** speedup compared to FP32 vectors

### Result Quality

- HalfVec (fp16) vectors return **97.5%** of the same results as FP32 vectors
- Bit vectors return **39.2%** of the same results as FP32 vectors

### Recommendations

- **HalfVec (fp16) is recommended** for this workload: significant performance improvement with minimal impact on result quality
- Bit vectors provide speed but with significant changes in results - consider using with reranking
